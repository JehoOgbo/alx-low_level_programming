This directory will be used to explore the concept of linked lists in C. Extensive coverage of manipulation of such lists including adding to any point on the list be it first or last or any other point, deletion from linked lists and printing the elements of the linked list will be studied.
Also, actual usefulness and usage of linked lists will be considered.
