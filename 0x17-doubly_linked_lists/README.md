This directory is to study and understand the doubly linked lists data structure in C.

This data structure is one whose elements can be traversed both in a forward and backward direction.
It therefore contains a pointer to the next element and one to the previous among other data.
Many operations will be carried out in this directory on doubly linked lists such as printing its elements, adding new elements, getting nodes at indices, etc.
This will be fun
